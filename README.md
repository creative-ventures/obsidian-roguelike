## How It Works

### Goal Structure

Each goal is a folder with a companion Markdown note:

```
My Project/
├── My Project.md          # Goal metadata
├── Research Phase/
│   ├── Research Phase.md
│   └── Gather Sources/
│       └── Gather Sources.md
└── [BOSS] Launch Day/     # Boss goals have [BOSS] prefix
    └── [BOSS] Launch Day.md
```

### Goal Note Format

```markdown
status:: open
boss:: false
xp:: 20
deadline:: 2026-02-15
author:: [[Your Name]]
blocker:: [[Other Task]]
created:: 2026-01-30

Short description of what needs to be done.
```

### XP System

| Action | XP |
|--------|-----|
| Complete goal | 10 base |
| Nested goal bonus | +5 per depth level |
| Boss goal | 3x multiplier |

### Achievements

Unlock achievements as you progress:
- 🏆 **First Blood** — Complete your first task
- 🔥 **On Fire** — 3-day streak
- 👑 **Boss Slayer** — Defeat a boss
- ⭐ **Centurion** — Complete 100 tasks

## Welcome Note

On first run, the plugin creates a `Welcome to Roguelike.md` note in your vault root containing:
- Your profile (level, XP, streak)

- Achievements gallery
- Inventory of collected loot
- Journal with task overview (overdue, upcoming, blocked)
- Help and hotkey reference

Use `Cmd+Shift+J` to update this note anytime.
